# RSA-project-
The goal is to implement the RSA public-key cryptosystem. The RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) cryptosystem is widely used for secure communication in browsers, bank ATM machines, credit card machines, mobile phones, smart cards, and the Windows operating system. It works by manipulating integers. To prevent listeners, the RSA cryptosystem must manipulate huge integers (hundreds of digits).
